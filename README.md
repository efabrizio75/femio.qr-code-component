## My process

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### Layout

The basic layout in which the QR code is rendered follows this markup:

```html
<div id="qr-card">
  <div class="container">
    <img class="qr-code">
    <p class="tagline"></p>
    <p class="info"></p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### What I learned

I learned how to use Repl.it to host my solutions even though I had selected Codepen.io at first.
